# The Periodic Table of Resonance
### A Reproducibility Study for the Information-Computational Universe (ICU) Theory

This repository contains the computational models and tutorial for the "Periodic Table of Resonance" discovery, as detailed in the paper *"The Information-Computational Universe (ICU) Theory"* by Michael J. Jensen.

The central thesis is that the architecture of matter is not a fundamental postulate but an **emergent property of a resonant substrate**. The entire periodic table of elements emerges from the stable, resonant harmonies of a single geometric shape tiled throughout the universe. This work provides the direct, reproducible simulation that demonstrates this principle.

## How to Reproduce This Discovery

As noted in Section 28.6 of the paper, the core simulations are computationally intensive and are designed to run for several hours on a modern multi-core CPU. **Therefore, they must be executed on a local machine.**

### System Requirements
*   Python 3.8+
*   NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
*   A multi-core CPU is recommended for reasonable performance.
*   At least 16GB of RAM.

### Step 1: Setup
First, clone this repository to your local machine and install the required Python libraries.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jensenium/ICU-Theory-Periodic-Table.git

# Navigate into the new directory
cd ICU-Theory-Periodic-Table

# Install required packages (Note: We will add the requirements.txt file later)
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib
